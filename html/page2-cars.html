                    The Otto Flugmaschinenfabrik was founded in 1910 by Gustav Otto in the Kingdom of Bavaria,<br> which
                    was
                    a state of the German Empire. The firm was reorganized on 7 March 1916 into Bayerische <br>
                    Flugzeugwerke
                    AG. This company was then renamed to Bayerische Motoren Werke (BMW) in 1922. <br> However, the name
                    BMW
                    dates back to 1913, when a company to use the name was founded by Karl <br> Rapp initially as Rapp
                    Motorenwerke. The name and Rapp Motorenwerke's engine-production assets <br> were transferred to
                    Bayerische Flugzeugwerke in 1922, who adopted the name the same year. BMW's <br> first product was
                    produced for fighter aircraft of the Luftstreitkrafte. It was a straight-six aircraft engine <br>
                    called
                    the BMW IIIa, designed in the spring of 1917 by engineer Max Friz. Following the end of World <br>
                    War I,
                    BMW remained in business by producing motorcycle engines, agricultural equipment, household <br>
                    items,
                    and railway brakes. The company produced its first motorcycle, the BMW R 32, in 1923.

            <span>The BMW 5 Series is an executive car manufactured and <br> by BMW since 1972, succeeding the New
                Class Sedans, <br> and currently in its eight generation.

                The 5 Series was <br> initially available as a sedan, with a wagon/estate body <br> style (marketed as
                "Touring")
                added in 1991 and a 5-door <br> fastback configuration (marketed as "Gran Turismo") available <br> from
                2009
                to
                2017. Each successive generation carries a distinct <br> internal E- designation.

                The first generation of 5 Series was powered <br> by naturally aspirated four-cylinder and six-cylinder
                petrol engines. <br> Following generations have been powered by four-cylinder, six-cylinder, <br> V8 and
                V10
                engines that are either naturally aspirated or turbocharged. <br> Since 1982, diesel engines have been
                included in the 5 Series. <br>

                The 5 Series is BMW's second-best-selling model after the 3 Series. <br> On 29 January 2008, the 5
                millionth 5 Series was manufactured, a 530d <br> sedan in Carbon Black Metallic.

                    Emil Jellinek-Mercedes, a Jewish-Austrian automobile entrepreneur who worked with DMG,<br>
                    registered
                    the trademark in 1902, naming the 1901 Mercedes 35 hp after his daughter Mercedes Jellinek.<br>
                    Jellinek
                    was a businessman and marketing strategist who promoted "horseless" Daimler automobiles among <br>
                    the
                    highest circles of society. At the time, it was a meeting place for the haute volée of France and
                    Europe,<br> especially in winter. His customers included the Rothschild family and other wealthy
                    clients, but as early as 1901,<br> he was selling Mercedes cars in the "New World" as well,
                    including to
                    billionaires Rockefeller, Astor, <br> Morgan, and Taylor. At the Nice race he attended in 1899,
                    Jellinek
                    drove under the pseudonym "Monsieur Mercédès". <br> Many consider that race the birth of
                    Mercedes-Benz as
                    a brand. In 1901, the name "Mercedes" <br> was re-registered by DMG worldwide as a protected
                    trademark.
                    The first Mercedes-Benz branded vehicles <br> were produced in 1926, following the merger of Karl
                    Benz
                    and Gottlieb Daimler's companies into <br> the Daimler-Benz company on 28 June of the same year.

                n 2015, Mercedes-Benz announced that development of a pickup truck <br> was in the works.[6] The new
                vehicle,

                <br>
                and
                Renault plants in Europe and South America.

                On 25 October 2016, <br> Mercedes-Benz announced a concept class called the X-Class Concept. <br> Dieter
                Zetsche,
                Daimler Chairman and head of Mercedes-Benz cars, <br> said it would help a growing segment. It was

                be only available <br> in Australia, New Zealand, Europe,
                Latin America, and Africa. The top <br>-of-the-range engine is a turbocharged diesel V6 paired with a
                4Matic <br>
                permanent all-wheel-drive system.

                    Kia was founded on June 9, 1944, as Kyungsung Precision Industry, a manufacturer of steel tubing
                    <br> and
                    bicycle parts, eventually producing Korea's first domestic bicycle, the Samchuly, in 1951. <br> In
                    1952, Kyungsung Precision Industry changed its name to Kia Industries, and later built
                    Honda <br>-licensed small motorcycles (starting in 1957) and Mazda-licensed trucks (1962) and cars
                    (1974). <br> The company opened its first integrated automotive assembly plant in 1973, the Sohari
                    Plant. <br> Kia built the small Mazda-based Brisa range of cars until 1981, when production came to
                    an <br> end after the new military dictator Chun Doo-hwan enforced industry consolidation. This
                    forced <br>
                    Kia to give up passenger cars and focus entirely on light trucks. Kia assembled a few hundred <br>
                    more cars in 1982 and 1983, after the ban had taken effect, but no passenger cars were built in <br>
                    1984
                    and 1985.

                The Kia Sportage (Korean: 기아 스포티지) is a series of <br> automobiles manufactured by the South Korean
                manufacturer <br> Kia since 1993 through five generations. Initially a compact <br> SUV built on a
                body-on-frame
                chassis, the second-generation <br> Sportage transitioned to a car-based platform which placed it <br>
                into
                the
                compact crossover SUV class, and has been developed <br> alongside the Hyundai Tucson. Since the
                fifth-generation model <br> launched in 2021, Kia developed the Sportage in two sizes with <br>
                different
                wheelbase lengths for different markets.

                    The company was originally founded as a spinoff of Toyota Industries, a machine maker <br> started
                    by
                    Sakichi Toyoda, Kiichiro's father. Both companies are now part of the Toyota <br> Group, one of the
                    largest conglomerates in the world. While still a department of Toyota <br> Industries, the company
                    developed its first product, the Type A engine, in 1934 and its <br> first passenger car in 1936,
                    the
                    Toyota AA.

                    After World War II, Toyota benefited from <br> Japan's alliance with the United States to learn from
                    American automakers and other <br> companies, which gave rise to The Toyota Way (a management
                    philosophy)
                    and the <br> Toyota Production System (a lean manufacturing practice) that transformed the small
                    <br>
                    company
                    into a leader in the industry and was the subject of many academic studies.

            <span>The initial four generations of the Supra were produced from <br> 1978 to 2002.The fifth generation
                has
                been produced since March <br> 2019 and went on sale in May 2019. The styling of the original <br> Supra
                was
                derived from the Toyota Celica, but it was longer. <br> Starting in mid-1986, the A70 Supra became a
                separate model <br> from the Celica. In turn, Toyota also stopped using the prefix <br> Celica and named
                the
                car
                Supra. Owing to the similarity and <br> past of the Celica's name, it is frequently mistaken for the
                Supra, <br> and vice versa. The first, second and third generations of the Supra were <br> assembled at
                the
                Tahara
                plant in Tahara, Aichi, while the fourth <br> generation was assembled at the Motomachi plant in
                Toyota
                City. <br>
                The 5th generation of the Supra is assembled alongside the G29 BMW <br> Z4 in Graz, Austria by Magna
                Steyr.
